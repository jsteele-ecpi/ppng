# PPNG
	A primitive program that probes, and injects, data in .png image files.

Inspired by Tsoding Daily [Hiding Information Inside of PNG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9Zwulv3xz8)	

This is intended for educational purposes only, to appease my curiosity. 

# quick start
```sh
$ ./build.sh
$ ./ppng <input_file.png> [output_file] 
```
